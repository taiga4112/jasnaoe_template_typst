	abstract = {Most cases of successfully designed hull forms developed using conventional nonlinear optimization methods propose the optimal candidates in a particular design constraint. Furthermore, these optimal designs contain uncertainties in terms of the evaluation parameters and design conditions, thereby raising the issue of robustness of the design idea that the designer needs to investigate to arrive at a decision for building the expensive structure of a ship. This paper proposes a method to organize and visualize the propulsive performance of any number of hull form combinations. The shape morphing technique, which has been limited to the blending of two or three hull forms, is extended to the shape morphing of N hull forms by introducing the concept of the barycentric coordinate system. Thus, a hull-form coordinate system with each hull form as a basis is proposed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by analyzing several hull-form design spaces. This method can contribute to improving the robustness of the optimal solution obtained by nonlinear optimization and machine learning, by analyzing and visualizing the design space around the optimal point.},

	abstract = {While data centers are increasingly important for modern society owing to the expansion in data processing demand, they also contribute to emissions and thus global warming. The design of such social infrastructure requires sociotechnical evaluation, including the identification of the different needs of multiple stakeholders. This study designs and proposes concepts for data center systems as integrated infrastructure consisting of both data center and green power plant in response to rapid regional growth and potential of offshore and nearshore infrastructure in Southeast Asia. To design such an infrastructure involving multiple stakeholders with differing needs, a systems approach is employed to analyze stakeholder values and system functions leads to the identification of key stakeholders and system requirements. Subsequently, a quantitative multi-objective model based on prioritized stakeholder needs and system requirements was developed to comprehensively evaluate the data center design tradespace. Simulation results of multiple location across the region imply that Singapore is an attractive location for investment given an offshore data center with an offshore fixed wind power plant that can contribute to a 50\% reduction in scaling difficulty and a 50\% reduction in lifetime {CO}2 emissions compared to onshore data centers with solar plants, while 5\% increase of total investment.},
